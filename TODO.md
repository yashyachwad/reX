# TODO: Fix Save & Exit Button in Edit Resume

## Problem
The "Save & Exit" button in the EditResume component is not working. It calls the `uploadResumeImages` function, which attempts to generate a thumbnail, upload it, update resume details, and navigate to dashboard. However, the process fails silently or with errors.

## Steps to Fix
1. **Investigate uploadResumeImages function**: Check for errors in html2canvas, dataURLtoFile, API calls, or state updates.
   - [x] Added detailed console.log statements to track each step of the uploadResumeImages function, including thumbnail element check, html2canvas call, dataURL generation, file creation, FormData preparation, API upload, and resume update.
2. **Add error handling and logging**: Enhance try-catch blocks to log more details and ensure errors are visible.
   - [x] Enhanced error logging with console.error for error message and stack trace.
3. **Verify thumbnail generation**: Ensure thumbnailRef is properly set and html2canvas can capture the element.
4. **Check API endpoints**: Confirm API_PATHS.RESUME.UPLOAD_IMAGES and UPDATE are correct and backend is responding.
5. **Test button functionality**: After fixes, test the button to ensure it saves and exits properly.
6. **Update TODO on completion**: Mark steps as done and note any changes made.

## Files to Modify
- RESUME/src/components/EditResume.jsx: Main file with the button and uploadResumeImages function.
  - [x] Added console.log statements throughout uploadResumeImages function for debugging.

## Undo Instructions
If "undo" is requested, revert changes to EditResume.jsx by removing the added console.log statements and restoring original error handling.

## Next Steps
- [x] Added more detailed logging for upload response data.
- [x] Removed completion field from updateResumeDetails to avoid 500 error.
- [x] Fixed MongoDB connection by using fallback URI.
- [x] Fixed schema types for skills and languages progress from String to Number.
- [x] Restarted backend server successfully.
- Tested the "Save & Exit" button - still failing with 500 error.
- Task marked as incomplete due to persistent issues.

## Final Status
The "Save & Exit" button is still not working. Changes made include enhanced logging, schema fixes, and backend connection fixes, but the root cause remains unresolved. User requested to leave it as is.
